  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to automatically categorize product descriptions from an e-commerce platform into different categories such as **electronics**, **clothing**, **furniture**, etc. Using **machine learning** and **NLP**, this project builds a model that can predict the category of a new product description.

The process involves:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Model training using **Logistic Regression** (or other classifiers like **SVM** or **Naive Bayes**)
- Model evaluation using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, and "recall"

 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning (removing special characters, stop words, etc.), tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming.
- Text Vectorization: Converting text to numeric vectors using techniques such as "TF-IDF" or "Word2Vec".
- Model Training: Training the classifier to predict the category based on product descriptions.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model on unseen test data using various performance metrics.
- Prediction: Using the trained model to classify new product descriptions.

Installation

To get started with this project, you will need Python 3.6 or higher and the following dependencies. You can install them using the `requirements.txt` file:

 Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-text-classification.git
cd ecommerce-text-classification
```

 Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if you are using **conda**:
```bash
conda create --name ecommerce_nlp python=3.8
conda activate ecommerce_nlp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Step 3: Download Data
Download or place your dataset (`ecommerce.train`, `ecommerce.test`) into the project directory.

 Data Preparation

This project uses labeled product descriptions for training and testing. The data should be in a tab-separated format, where each line consists of:
- A label (category) and
- A product description

Example:
```
electronics  4K smart TV with HDR and Dolby Vision
furniture    Ergonomic office chair with lumbar support
clothing     Men's running shoes, lightweight and breathable
```

   Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps are performed:
- **Lowercasing**: All text is converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words.
- **Stopword Removal**: Removing common words like "the", "is", "and", etc.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
- **Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical format using **TF-IDF** or other techniques.

 Model Training

Once the data is preprocessed, the next step is to train a classifier on the training data.

Example of training a model using "Logistic Regression":

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load and preprocess data
train_data = open("ecommerce.train", "r").readlines()
test_data = open("ecommerce.test", "r").readlines()

# Prepare data (splitting labels and text)
train_labels, train_texts = zip(*[line.strip().split("\t") for line in train_data])
test_labels, test_texts = zip(*[line.strip().split("\t") for line in test_data])

# Vectorize the text
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_texts)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_texts)

# Train a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, train_labels)

# Make predictions and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(test_labels, predictions))
```

You can replace **Logistic Regression** with other classifiers like "Naive Bayes", "SVM"", or "Random Forest" to see how they perform on your data.

 Model Evaluation

After training the model, evaluate its performance using various metrics:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
- Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions over all positive predictions.
- Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions over all actual positives.
- F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The following script demonstrates model evaluation:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Evaluate performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, predictions)
precision = precision_score(test_labels, predictions, average='weighted')
recall = recall_score(test_labels, predictions, average='weighted')
f1 = f1_score(test_labels, predictions, average='weighted')

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
print(f"F1-Score: {f1}")
```

 How to Use

After training the model, you can use it to predict the category of a new product description. Here's an example:

```python
product_description = "Smartphone with 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage, and 12MP Camera"
predicted_category = model.predict([product_description])
print(f"Predicted Category: {predicted_category[0]}")
```
